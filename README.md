# Count-Down-Timer
Welcome to the Countdown Timer Internship Project at Unified Mentor!

This project is designed to enhance your skills in web development, specifically focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly countdown timer application.

## Project Overview

The Countdown Timer project aims to develop a web application that allows users to set a specific date and time in the future, and then it will count down to that moment, displaying the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

This includes the ability to handle multiple countdowns, provide notifications when the timer reaches zero, and ensure a visually appealing interface.
